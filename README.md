# KinectProject

This is a Kinect v2 project.

Using Kinect Sensor to detect hand or finger gesture and send the result as a special code to a Python Server, then the Python Server will transmit it to the correlative Android Service. 

Different code will be treated as different situation and the Android Service will warn in different level.
